# Text To Speech

This repository contains the source code for a **Text-to-Speech** (TTS) application. The project allows users to convert written text into spoken words using advanced 
speech synthesis techniques. It supports multiple languages and voices, providing a flexible and accessible solution for various applications.

## Features

- **Text-to-Speech Conversion:** Easily convert any given text into speech.
- **Multiple Languages Support:** The system supports multiple languages for text-to-speech conversion.
- **Customizable Voices:** Choose from different voices (male, female, etc.).
- **Speech Rate Control:** Control the speed of the generated speech.
- **Audio Download:** Ability to download the generated speech as an audio file.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python (Flask or Django)
- **Text-to-Speech Engine:** Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS), pyttsx3, or any other TTS library
- **Frontend (Optional):** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React, Vue, or Angular if used for frontend interface)
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## Installation

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Install dependencies:**

3. **Run the application:**

```bash
python app.py
```

   The application will start, and you can access the Text-to-Speech service locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### Environment Variables

If needed, set up any necessary environment variables such as API keys or configuration settings.

Example `.env` file:

```
API_KEY=your-api-key
```

## Usage

1. **Access the Application:**
   - If you have a frontend interface, navigate to the application in your browser.
   - If the project is purely backend, you can interact with the API using tools like **Postman** or **curl**.

2. **Text-to-Speech API:**
   - Send a POST request to the appropriate endpoint with the text you want to convert to speech.
   - The response will either return the audio file or provide a link to download it.
